# Getting Discord IDs

In some parts of Hyra, you may need to input a Discord ID to take advantage of a feature. A Discord ID is a unique set of numbers that **never** change. These are great for identifying users for computers, but not so great for humans.

## What does a Discord ID look like?
A Discord ID is a unique set of numbers that are typically 17 digits in length. For example: `748658551249174569`.

## How to get the ID
To get the ID, you will need to enable Developer Mode. To enable Developer Mode click on the settings cog in the bottom left corner. Go to Appearance -> all the way at the bottom. Toggle "Developer Mode" on.

When you right click a user, you will now see the option to "Copy ID".
