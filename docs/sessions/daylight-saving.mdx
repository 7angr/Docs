# Daylight Saving

When you create a session in Hyra, we use the **current timezone offset**. This means if you created a session for 5pm EST during July, daylight saving would be applied to all of the sessions going forward.

When November comes along and daylight saving ends, your session will **not** automatically go backwards, so you will need to reconfigure your session time to match the new offset.

:::note

This applies for **all timezones**.

## When do my sessions need to be updated for daylight saving?

:::info

Hyra will **not** automatically update your offsets - you will need to do this yourself

## Technical Information
Technically speaking, Hyra stores the time of your session as a UTC timestamp, and UTC follows no daylight saving. This means that when common timezones such as EST and GMT/BST swap between their respective daylight saving/no daylight saving times, the sessions do not change as well.
