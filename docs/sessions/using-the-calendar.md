# Using the Calendar

You can easily switch between days when viewing sessions. We calculate all of your sessions in advance, so you can simply flick through the days.

To switch the day click on the day you want to view. By default, the week starts on Monday. You can view up to 7 days in advance.

### My calendar is missing sessions
In some very rare cases, your Sessions Calendar can drop sessions due to an outdated or misculated index. To resolve this, follow the instructions below (you must be an Administrator on the Workspace):

1. Navigate to Settings (bottom left)
2. Select Sessions
3. Click the Toolbox Icon (top right)
4. Click "Rebuild Index"

If the rebuild index button is not available, or you cannot see the Toolbox icon, please contact support.
