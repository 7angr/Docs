# Local Time Display

For the convenience of your staff, Hyra automatically converts the time of your sessions into the users local time.

<img src="/img/session-display.png" width="500px"/>

This is displayed above the **name** of your session in smaller text. In the example pictured above, we have named the session **12:00am EST Training** which is an optimal way of naming your sessions.

We automatically calculate this time using the users device time, it is not possible for you to disable this at this time.
