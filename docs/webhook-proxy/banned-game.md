# Suspended Game/Webhook

Sometimes we need to ban games or webhooks from the service due to persistent abuse.

## Webhook Bans

If your webhook has been banned, please create a new webhook in Discord app and replace your URL. Ensure that your previous use case is in full compliance with the policies to avoid future suspensions.

## Game Bans

If your game has been banned from using the Hyra Webhook Proxy, Hyra will **not** lift the ban. These bans are put in place when you have persistently abused the service. Hyra is not required to provide you with this service.
